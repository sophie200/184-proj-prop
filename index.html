		<h2>Summary</h2>
		The goal of our project is to create an all-in-one solution that helps users create 3D meshes using common technology available to most people. Our project makes use of the iPhone LiDAR to generate a point cloud, and convert the point cloud to a mesh using the Ball-Pivoting algorithm. The final output will be a 3D mesh file that the user can open up in any 3D software and postprocess for printing, etc.

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
		
		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>			<h3>What We Plan to Deliver</h3>
			<!--What do we need to deliver, bare min to achieve our desired grade-->
			W!--lan to deliver a 



			We plan to deliver a pipeline that uses LiDAR to create a point cloud representation of a 3D object and convert it to a mesh, using the Ball Pivoting-Algorithm for Surface Reconstruction.
			<!--Descibe expected output-->
			<!--Describe how we plan to measure quality/performance-->
			We can measure the quality of our mesh output using the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository for our testing suite. We can get point clouds using the raw data from the repository, run them through our pipeline, and then compare our generated mesh with the mesh from the repository. <!--TODO: Research to find an error function-->
			<h3>What We Hope to Deliver</h3>
			<!--Additional work we can do if we achieve our initial goal-->
			If we get ahead of schedule, we hope to add another stage to the pipeline, in which we can project textures onto our generated mesh. <!--TODO: Finish Add detail about how we do this--></p1>
		<h2>Schedule</h2>

			<li>You can also add code if you'd like as so: <code>code code code</code></li>
			<li>If you'd like to add math equations, 
				<ul>
					<li>You can write inline equations like so: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)</li>
					<li>You can write display equations like so: \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]</li>
